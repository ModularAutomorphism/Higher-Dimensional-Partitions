Note:
1. BM.pyx contains the Cython file for computing the number of partitions. Cythonize the file and then run Test_BM.py file.
2. Tot_n.pyx contains the Cython file for computing number of incoming edges at some arbitrary depth level in the partition graph. Cythonize the file and then run Test_Tot_n.py file.
